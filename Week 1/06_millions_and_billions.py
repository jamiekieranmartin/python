# Millions and billions
#
# The words "millions" and "billions" sound similar, and not long ago
# you were considered rich if you were a millionaire, but now rich
# people are billionaires.  So is a million really very different from
# a billion?
#
# One way to get an intuitive appreciation for how close or far apart
# two numbers are is to express them in familiar units.
# In this exercise you will calculate one million seconds in days and
# and one billion seconds in years to see the difference.
# 
# Before you begin, try guessing what the answers will be.
# How many days is a million seconds?
# How many years is a billion seconds?
#
# (Irrelevant historical aside: For the purposes of this exercise
# we assume that a million is one thousand thousands, and a billion
# is one thousand million.  However, this definition of a billion
# comes to us from the United States of America only recently.  In
# Britain a "billion" used to be defined as a *million* million.  It
# was thus a lot easier to become a billionaire in the US than the
# UK!  The old British word for a thousand million was a "milliard".
# Today, however, the US definition has become accepted worldwide.)
#

# Here are some constant values you can use in your solution

seconds_per_minute = 60

minutes_per_hour = 60

hours_per_day = 24

minutes_per_day = minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day

days_per_year = 365 # ignoring leap years


# Your challenge, part one: Below write code for calculating
# how many days there are in a million seconds and print the
# result to the screen.  Use floating point arithmetic to do
# the calculation and round off your answer to a whole number
# before printing it.

seconds = (10 ** 6) #1 million seconds
days_in_million_seconds = ((seconds / seconds_per_minute) / minutes_per_hour) / hours_per_day  # arithmetic to find the number of days in 1 million seconds
print("Number of Days in 1 million seconds is equal to", round(days_in_million_seconds)) #prints number of days in 1 million seconds

# Your challenge, part two: Below write code for calculating
# how many years there are in a billion seconds and print the
# result to the screen.  Use floating point arithmetic to do
# the calculation and round off your answer to a whole number
# before printing it.

seconds_2= (10 ** 9)
years_in_billion_seconds = ((((seconds_2 / seconds_per_minute) / minutes_per_hour) / hours_per_day) / days_per_year)
print("Number of Years in 1 billion seconds is equal to", round(years_in_billion_seconds))
